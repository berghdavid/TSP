Solution for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Haskell
David Bergh (berghdavid@hotmail.com)

Solution is based on Java implementation of same problem made by Rajput-Ji.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-implementation-using-backtracking/

Compile and run to test different number of iterations and graphs.
